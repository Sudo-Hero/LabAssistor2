In C++, you can use the Windows API to detect whether a mouse is present on the system. Here's a basic example of how you can check for the presence of a mouse using the Windows API:

cpp
Copy code
#include <windows.h>

int main() {
    if (GetSystemMetrics(SM_MOUSEPRESENT) != 0) {
        // A mouse is present on the system
        printf("A mouse is present on the system.\n");
    } else {
        // No mouse detected
        printf("No mouse detected on the system.\n");
    }

    return 0;
}
In this example:

We use the GetSystemMetrics function with the SM_MOUSEPRESENT parameter. This function retrieves system metrics information, and SM_MOUSEPRESENT specifically checks whether a mouse is present.

If GetSystemMetrics(SM_MOUSEPRESENT) returns a non-zero value, it means that a mouse is present on the system.

If GetSystemMetrics(SM_MOUSEPRESENT) returns 0, it means that no mouse is detected on the system.

This method is a straightforward way to determine if a mouse is present, and it doesn't require any additional libraries or complex code.
